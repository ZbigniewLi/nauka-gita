        <h1>Like a stone</h1> 
        <h4>by Audioslave</h4>
        <p>On a cobweb afternoon</p>
        <p>In a room full of emptiness</p>
        <p>By a freeway I confess</p>   
        <p>I was lost in the pages</p> 
        <p>Of a book full of death</p> 
        <p>Reading how we'll die alone</p>
        <p>Reading how we'll die alone</p>
        <p>In your house, I long to be</p>   
        <p>Room by room, patiently</p>
        <p> I'll wait for you there</p>   
        <p></p>   Like a stone
        <p>I'll wait for you there</p>  
        <p></p>   Alone
        <p>And on my deathbed I will pray</p>  
        <p>To the gods and the angel</p>  
        <p>Like a pagan to anyone</p> 
        <p>Who will take me to heaven</p>  
        <p>To a place I recall</p>  
        <p> I was there so long ago</p>  
        <p>The sky was bruised</p>  
        <p>  The wine was bled</p>   
        <p>And there you led me on</p>   
        <p>In your house, I long to be</p>   
        <p>Room by room, patiently</p>  
        <p> I'll wait for you there</p> 
        <p>Like a stone</p> 
        <p>I'll wait for you there</p>  
        <p> Alone</p>
